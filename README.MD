The main purpose of the tool is to streamline metadata and sources publishing/retrieving from IPFS.
It comes with few assumptions and limitations:
* Current version of Truffle does not allow generating metadata files separately
* It also prepends suffixes to source paths in metadata which makes final IPFS hash differ from the one, generated by solicidy
